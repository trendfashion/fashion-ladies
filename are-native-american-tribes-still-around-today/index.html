They may wonder if these tribes still exist, and if so, how they are doing in today's society. Additionally, people may wonder if the traditions and culture of these tribes are still being practiced today. These questions can be difficult to answer, especially for those who have not had much exposure to Native American culture.</p><h2>Answering the Target</h2><p>The answer is yes, Native American tribes still exist today. In fact, there are over 500 federally recognized tribes in the United States.
