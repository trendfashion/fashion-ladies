However, with the passage of time, there has been a lot of speculation about whether or not Native American tribes still exist today. This article aims to provide readers with accurate information on the current status of Native American tribes in America.</p><h2>Pain Points Related to Native American Tribes</h2><p>Many people have questions about the existence of Native American tribes in America. They may wonder if these tribes still exist, and if so, how they are doing in today's society. Additionally, people may wonder if the traditions and culture of these tribes are still being practiced today. These questions can be difficult to answer, especially for those who have not had much exposure to Native American culture.</p><h2>Answering the Target</h2><p>The answer is yes, Native American tribes still exist today. In fact, there are over 500 federally recognized tribes in the United States. These tribes are recognized by the federal government and have a government-to-government relationship with the United States.
