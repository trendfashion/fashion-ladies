Here are some of the most popular types:</p><h3>Oxford Shoes:</h3><p>Oxford shoes are a classic style that never goes out of fashion.

They are available in leather, suede, or other materials, making them versatile for different occasions.</p><h2>Factors to Consider when Choosing Men's Formal Shoes</h2><p>Choosing the best men's formal shoes in India comes down to several factors. Here are some of the most important ones to consider:</p><h3>Style:</h3><p>The style of the formal shoes you choose will depend on the occasion and your personal taste.
