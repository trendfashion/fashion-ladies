However, Depop takes a 10% commission on all sales, which can be a downside for some sellers.</p><p><h3>Vinted</h3></p><p>Vinted is another popular platform for selling second hand clothes online in the UK. The app allows you to upload items for free and takes a 5% commission on all sales. Vinted also offers a buyer protection program and a simple selling process.</p><p><h4>How to Sell on These Platforms</h4></p><p>When selling second hand clothes online, there are a few tips to keep in mind.
