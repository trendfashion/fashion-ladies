However, after trying this recipe, I realized how simple it can be! The ingredients are easy to find, and the process is straightforward. </p><p>To make a classic easy tiramisu recipe, you'll need the following ingredients:</p><ul><li>6 egg yolks</li><li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li><li>2/3 cup milk</li><li>1 1/4 cups heavy cream</li><li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><li>1 pound mascarpone cheese</li><li>1/2 cup strong brewed coffee or espresso</li><li>24-30 ladyfingers</li><li>Cocoa powder, for dusting</li></ul><p><h2>Steps:</h2></p><h3>Step 1: Make the custard</h3><p>In a medium saucepan, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until well combined. Add the milk and whisk until all ingredients are combined. Cook the mixture over medium heat, whisking constantly, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from heat and let it cool for 5 minutes.</p><h4>Tip:</h4><p>Be sure to whisk the mixture frequently to avoid any lumps. Also, don't let the mixture boil, as this can cause it to curdle.</p><h3>Step 2: Whip the cream</h3><p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the heavy cream and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form. Add the mascarpone cheese and beat until well combined.</p><h4>Tip:</h4><p>Be careful not to overbeat the cream, as this can cause it to become grainy.</p><h3>Step 3: Combine the custard and cream</h3><p>Gently fold the cooled custard into the whipped cream mixture until well combined.</p><h4>Tip:</h4><p>When folding the custard into the cream, be gentle to avoid deflating the mixture.</p><h3>Step 4: Assemble the tiramisu</h3><p>Dip each ladyfinger into the coffee or espresso and place it in a single layer in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Spread half of the cream mixture over the ladyfingers. Repeat with another layer of soaked ladyfingers and the remaining cream mixture. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.</p><h4>Tip:</h4><p>Be sure to dip the ladyfingers quickly, as they can become too soggy if left in the coffee or espresso for too long.</p><h3>Step 5: Serve</h3><p>When ready to serve, dust the top of the tiramisu with cocoa powder.</p><h4>Tip:</h4><p>To make the tiramisu look even more impressive, you can pipe additional whipped cream on top.</p><p><h2>History of Tiramisu</h2></p><p>Tiramisu is a classic Italian dessert that has been enjoyed for decades.
