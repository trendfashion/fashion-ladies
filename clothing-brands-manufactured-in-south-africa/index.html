Their clothing is made using natural fabrics such as organic cotton, hemp, and linen, and they use non-toxic dyes to minimise their environmental impact.

The JoineryThe Joinery is a Johannesburg-based brand that produces high-quality, locally-made clothing for men and women. They use sustainable fabrics such as bamboo, hemp, and organic cotton, and they are committed to ethical production practices. I have a pair of bamboo leggings from The Joinery, and they are so comfortable and long-lasting.3. LunarLunar is another Cape Town-based brand that produces locally-made clothing using sustainable and ethical practices. Their garments are made using natural fabrics such as linen, and they use natural dyes to minimise their environmental impact. Lunar is committed to transparency in their production process, and they even have a &#34;Trace Your Garment&#34; feature on their website that allows you to see exactly where your garment came from.4.

They use natural fabrics such as linen and organic cotton, and they are committed to transparency in their production process. Esse also has a zero-waste policy, which means that they use every scrap of fabric, and they even offer a recycling program for their clothing.Question and Answer SectionQ: Are these brands affordable?
