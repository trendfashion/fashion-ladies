Sort your clothes: Separate your clothes into piles of similar items, such as dresses, pants, and shirts. This will make it easier for the store to assess your items.</p><h2>How to Find Second Hand Stores That Buy Clothes</h2><p>Now that you've prepared your clothes, it's time to find a second hand store that buys clothes. Here are some ways to locate stores:</p><p>1. Google search: Do a quick search for second hand stores in your area, and check their websites to see if they buy clothes.</p><p>2. Yelp: Look up second hand stores on Yelp and filter your search to only show stores that buy clothes.</p><p>3. Social media: Check out local buy/sell/trade groups on Facebook or Instagram. Many second hand stores advertise their buying services on these platforms.</p><h2>What to Expect When Selling Your Clothes</h2><p>When you arrive at the second hand store, a buyer will assess your items and make you an offer. Here are some things to keep in mind:</p><p>1. Don't expect to get rich: Second hand stores typically pay a fraction of what you paid for your clothes. Don't expect to make a fortune, but do expect to make some money.</p><p>2. Be prepared to negotiate: If the store offers you a price that you're not happy with, don't be afraid to negotiate. Just be reasonable and don't expect to get an offer much higher than the original.</p><p>3. Don't take it personally: If the store doesn't want to buy your items, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean your clothes aren't great, it just means they don't fit the store's current inventory needs.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: What types of clothes do second hand stores typically buy?</strong></p><p>A: Second hand stores typically buy gently used, on-trend clothing items. This includes items such as dresses, pants, shirts, and jackets.</p><p><strong>Q: Do second hand stores buy designer clothing?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, many second hand stores do buy designer clothing. However, the price they offer will likely be less than the original retail price.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I sell my clothes online instead of going to a second hand store?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, there are many online marketplaces, such as Poshmark and ThredUp, where you can sell your clothes. However, keep in mind that these platforms typically take a commission from your sales.</p><p><strong>Q: What should I do with clothes that don't sell?</strong></p><p>A: If your clothes don't sell at the second hand store, consider donating them to a local charity or thrift store.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Selling your clothes to second hand stores can be a great way to make some extra cash and clear out your closet. By preparing your clothes, finding the right store, and knowing what to expect, you can have a successful selling experience. Happy selling!</p></article>
