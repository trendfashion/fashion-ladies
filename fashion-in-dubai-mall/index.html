Make a list of the stores you want to visit and prioritize them based on your style and budget.</p><p>Next, consider the layout of the mall. Dubai Mall is divided into different sections, including Fashion Avenue, The Village, and The Souk. Fashion Avenue is home to the luxury boutiques and high-end designer stores, while The Village has more high-street and contemporary brands. The Souk offers a more traditional shopping experience with stores selling local handicrafts and souvenirs.</p><p>Once you have a plan in place, it's time to hit the stores.

The store offers a range of local and international brands, all with a unique and quirky twist. From statement jewelry to bold prints, you're sure to find something that will make you stand out.</p><p><h4>Fashion in Dubai Mall: Tips for Saving Money</h4></p><p>Shopping in Dubai Mall can be expensive, but there are ways to save money while still shopping in style.
