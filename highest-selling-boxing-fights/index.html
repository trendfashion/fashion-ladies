From the physicality of the sport to the drama of the rivalries, there's something about boxing that draws people in. Some of the most memorable fights in history have been the highest selling boxing fights, and today we're going to take a look at some of them.</p><p>For many people, the thought of boxing brings to mind images of two fighters going head to head in a brutal fight. While this is certainly an aspect of the sport, there's much more to it than that. The highest selling boxing fights are often the ones that are the most emotionally charged, with fighters putting everything on the line to prove their worth.</p><p>So, what is the target of highest selling boxing fights? Simply put, it's to put on a show that will captivate audiences and create a sense of excitement and drama. From the fighters to the promoters to the fans, everyone involved in a boxing match wants to see something that will leave a lasting impression.</p><p>In this article, we'll take a look at some of the highest selling boxing fights in history, what made them so memorable, and the impact they had on the sport.</p><h2>The Thrilla in Manila</h2><p>The 1975 fight between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, known as "The Thrilla in Manila," is widely considered one of the greatest boxing matches of all time. The two fighters had a long-standing rivalry, and this fight was the third and final match in their trilogy.</p><p>As for what made this fight so memorable, it was a combination of factors. For one, the two fighters were evenly matched, both in terms of their skills and their animosity towards each other. Additionally, the fight took place in extreme heat and humidity, with both fighters pushing themselves to their absolute limits.</p><p>When it was all over, Ali emerged as the victor, but both fighters had given it their all. The fight is remembered as an epic battle between two of the greatest fighters of all time, and it helped cement Ali's legacy as one of the greatest boxers in history.</p><h2>The Fight of the Century</h2><p>The 1971 match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, known as "The Fight of the Century," was one of the most highly anticipated boxing matches in history. Both fighters were undefeated at the time, and the buildup to the fight was intense.</p><p>When the two finally met in the ring, it was a back-and-forth battle that saw both fighters land some heavy blows. In the end, Frazier emerged as the winner, handing Ali his first professional loss.</p><p>The fight was a huge event, with celebrities and dignitaries in attendance, and it set the stage for the epic rivalry between Ali and Frazier that would follow.</p><h3>The Rumble in the Jungle</h3><p>The 1974 fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, known as "The Rumble in the Jungle," is perhaps best remembered for Ali's famous "rope-a-dope" technique. Essentially, Ali allowed Foreman to tire himself out by punching him repeatedly while Ali leaned on the ropes. Then, in the eighth round, Ali came out swinging and knocked Foreman out.</p><p>The fight was a huge upset, as Foreman was heavily favored to win. It also marked a turning point in Ali's career, as many had doubted his abilities after he lost to Frazier a few years earlier.</p><h4>The Mayweather-Pacquiao Fight</h4><p>The 2015 fight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao was one of the most highly anticipated boxing matches in recent history. Both fighters were at the top of their game, and fans had been clamoring for the two to face off for years.</p><p>The fight itself was a bit of a letdown, however, as Mayweather ultimately emerged as the winner in a relatively uneventful match. Still, the fight was a huge event, with celebrities and fans from around the world tuning in to watch.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p><strong>Q: What makes a boxing match memorable?</strong></p><p>A: A memorable boxing match is one that is emotionally charged, with fighters putting everything on the line to prove their worth.

They also help to cement the legacies of the fighters involved, making them legends in the sport.</p><p><strong>Q: What are some other notable boxing matches?</strong></p><p>A: Some other notable boxing matches include the 1997 fight between Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield (which saw Tyson bite off a piece of Holyfield's ear), the 1964 fight between Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston (which saw Ali win the championship at just 22 years old), and the 1985 fight between Marvin Hagler and Thomas Hearns (which lasted just eight minutes but is widely considered one of the greatest fights in history).</p><p><strong>Q: What's next for boxing?</strong></p><p>A: While it's impossible to predict the future of the sport, it's clear that there will always be interest in the highest selling boxing fights.
