Additionally, many of these brands are now making efforts to be more sustainable and ethical, which is important for many consumers.</p><p>The target of international clothing brands in Bangladesh is generally the middle- to upper-class population. These brands offer a wide range of products, from high-end designer clothing to more affordable everyday wear.
