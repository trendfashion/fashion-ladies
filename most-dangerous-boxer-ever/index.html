It was as if you could feel the force behind each blow.</p><h3>Tyson's Infamous Biting Incident</h3><p>In 1997, Tyson was disqualified from a fight against Evander Holyfield for biting off a piece of his opponent's ear. This incident cemented Tyson's reputation as a dangerous and unpredictable fighter.</p><p>Personal Experience: I remember being shocked and disgusted by the biting incident. It was a clear example of Tyson's lack of control and disregard for the rules of the sport.</p><h2>Tyson's Legacy</h2><p>Despite his troubled past, Tyson is still considered one of the greatest boxers of all time.
