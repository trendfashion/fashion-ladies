We'll also explore the history behind these brands and their impact on streetwear culture.</p><p><h2>FUBU</h2></p><p>One of the most recognizable old school urban clothing brands is FUBU. Founded in 1992 by Daymond John, FUBU (which stands for "For Us, By Us") was created as a way to celebrate and represent black culture. The brand's signature look includes oversized jerseys, baggy jeans, and bold prints.</p><p>Personally, I remember wearing FUBU in the late 90s and early 2000s. I loved the way the clothes made me feel - confident, stylish, and like I was part of something bigger than myself. FUBU represented a movement, a way for black people to express themselves and show off their culture.</p><p><h2>Karl Kani</h2></p><p>Karl Kani is another iconic old school urban clothing brand.

I remember seeing rappers like Tupac and Biggie wearing Karl Kani clothes in their music videos, and thinking how cool they looked. Karl Kani was a pioneer in streetwear fashion, and his influence can still be seen today.</p><p><h3>Air Jordan</h3></p><p>While not exclusively a streetwear brand, Air Jordan is still one of the most iconic old school urban clothing brands. The brand was created in 1984 by Nike, in collaboration with basketball legend Michael Jordan. Air Jordans are known for their unique design and high level of comfort, making them a favorite among sneakerheads and basketball fans alike.</p><p>As someone who loves sneakers, I can attest to the appeal of Air Jordans.

And with new releases coming out every year, there's always something to look forward to.</p><p><h4>How to Shop for Old School Urban Clothing Brands</h4></p><p>If you're interested in trying out old school urban clothing brands for yourself, there are a few things to keep in mind.
