The saree is usually made of silk, cotton, or chiffon and comes in a wide range of colors and designs. It can be draped in different ways, depending on the region and occasion.</p><p>As an Indian woman, I have worn sarees for various occasions, such as weddings, festivals, and family gatherings. One of my favorite sarees is a vibrant pink and gold silk saree that I wore to my sister's wedding. It was adorned with intricate embroidery and made me feel elegant and beautiful.</p><p><h2>What is a Salwar Kameez?</h2></p><p>A salwar kameez is a two-piece outfit consisting of a long tunic (kameez) and loose-fitting pants (salwar). The kameez can be short or long and is often paired with a dupatta (scarf). Salwar kameez is commonly worn by women in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.</p><p>During my college days, I used to wear salwar kameez to class.

Alternatively, you can do some research online and look for inspiration from Bollywood movies or fashion bloggers.</p><p>When choosing Indian clothing, consider the occasion and your personal style.
