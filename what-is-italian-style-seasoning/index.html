I also like to sprinkle it on roasted vegetables or grilled meats for an easy weeknight meal.</p><p><h2>How to Use Italian Style Seasoning</h2></p><p>The easiest way to use Italian style seasoning is to simply sprinkle it on your food before or after cooking. You can also mix it into sauces or marinades for an extra punch of flavor. Keep in mind that a little goes a long way, so start with a small amount and adjust to your liking.</p><p>If you're feeling adventurous, you can also try making your own Italian seasoning blend at home. All you need is a combination of dried herbs and spices, such as basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary, garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix them together in a jar and store in a cool, dry place for up to six months.</p><p><h3>Benefits of Using Italian Style Seasoning</h3></p><p>In addition to its delicious flavor, Italian style seasoning also has some health benefits. Many of the herbs and spices used in the blend have anti-inflammatory properties and can help boost your immune system. Plus, using seasoning blends instead of salt can help reduce your sodium intake.</p><p><h4>How to Make Italian Style Seasoning</h4></p><p>If you want to make your own Italian style seasoning blend, here's a simple recipe to try:</p><ul><li>2 tablespoons dried basil</li><li>2 tablespoons dried oregano</li><li>2 tablespoons dried thyme</li><li>2 tablespoons dried rosemary</li><li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li><li>2 tablespoons onion powder</li></ul><p>Mix all of the ingredients together in a jar and store in a cool, dry place for up to six months.</p><p><h2>FAQs About Italian Style Seasoning</h2></p><p><strong>Q: Can I use Italian style seasoning in non-Italian dishes?</strong></p><p>A: Absolutely! Italian style seasoning can be used in a variety of dishes, from roasted vegetables to grilled meats and even scrambled eggs.</p><p><strong>Q: What's the difference between Italian seasoning and Italian style seasoning?</strong></p><p>A: Italian seasoning typically includes a blend of dried herbs such as basil, oregano, and thyme.

Just keep in mind that the flavor may be slightly different and you'll need to adjust the amounts accordingly.</p><p><strong>Q: Is Italian style seasoning gluten-free?</strong></p><p>A: As long as the individual herbs and spices used in the blend are gluten-free, then the seasoning blend should be as well. However, it's always a good idea to double-check the ingredients before using.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of What is Italian Style Seasoning</h2></p><p>Italian style seasoning is a versatile blend of herbs and spices that can elevate the flavor of your meals.
