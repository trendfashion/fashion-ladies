Ecosystems provide us with clean air and water, food, medicine, and other resources that we depend on for our survival. By protecting these ecosystems, we can ensure that they continue to provide for us in the years to come.</p><p><h3>How Can We Protect Natural Heritage?</h3></p><p>There are many ways that we can protect natural heritage. One of the most important is to reduce our impact on the environment by using fewer resources and producing less waste. This can include things like recycling, using public transportation, and conserving energy at home.</p><p>Another way to protect natural heritage is to support conservation efforts and advocacy groups that work to protect endangered species and ecosystems. By donating money or volunteering your time, you can help to make a difference in the fight to protect our planet.</p><p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p><p>In conclusion, natural heritage is an important concept that we should all strive to understand and protect. By doing so, we can help to preserve the beauty and diversity of our planet for future generations to enjoy. Whether it's through reducing our environmental impact, supporting conservation efforts, or simply taking a walk in nature, there are many ways that we can make a difference in the fight to protect our natural heritage.</p><p><h2>What is Meant by Natural Heritage?</h2></p><p>When we talk about natural heritage, we're referring to the natural features, places, and ecosystems that exist in our world.
