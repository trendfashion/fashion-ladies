You don't want to offend anyone by wearing something inappropriate, but you also don't want to stick out like a sore thumb. In this post, we will guide you through what you should wear to an Indian wedding as a white person.</p><p>Indian weddings are known for their vibrant colors, intricate designs, and rich culture. It is important to respect the customs and traditions of the wedding by dressing appropriately. Not only will this show your appreciation for the culture, but it will also help you blend in with the rest of the guests.</p><p>The ideal outfit for a white person attending an Indian wedding would be a traditional Indian attire such as a saree or a salwar kameez. However, if you are not comfortable wearing these outfits, you can opt for a western-style outfit that is in line with Indian wedding attire. For women, this could be a long flowy dress with a dupatta (scarf) or a lehenga (long skirt) with a crop top. Men can wear a sherwani (long coat) with a kurta (long shirt) and churidar (tight pants) or a suit with a Nehru jacket.</p><p>To ensure that your outfit is appropriate, it is best to check with the bride or groom or someone in the wedding party before deciding on what to wear. They will be able to guide you on the dress code and help you choose an outfit that is suitable for the occasion. It is also important to keep in mind the venue and the time of the wedding. If the wedding is in a temple or a traditional venue, it is best to dress conservatively. If the wedding is in a hotel or a modern venue, you can opt for a more modern outfit.</p><p>In summary, the key to dressing appropriately for an Indian wedding as a white person is to respect the culture and traditions while also feeling comfortable in your outfit.
