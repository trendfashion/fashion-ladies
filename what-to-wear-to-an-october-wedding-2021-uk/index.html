It's always better to be overdressed than underdressed. </p><p><h2>Dress Code: Formal</h2></p><p>Recently, I attended a wedding with a formal dress code. I wore a black dress with heels and accessorized with a clutch and some jewelry. The dress code required men to wear a tuxedo or a dark suit and tie. Women were expected to wear a long formal gown or a dressy cocktail dress. Formal attire usually means black tie, so make sure to wear something elegant and sophisticated.</p><p><h2>Dress Code: Semi-Formal</h2></p><p>For a semi-formal dress code, men can wear a suit and tie or dress pants with a blazer. Women can wear a cocktail dress or a dressy skirt and top. As the name suggests, semi-formal is not as dressy as a formal dress code, but it still requires you to look polished and put together.</p><p><h3>What to Wear: Accessories</h3></p><p>Accessories are an essential part of any outfit, and they can make or break your look. For a wedding, it's best to keep it simple and elegant. You don't want to wear anything too flashy or distracting. Choose one statement piece, like a necklace or earrings, and keep the rest of your accessories minimal.</p><p><h4>How to Dress for the Weather</h4></p><p>October can be a tricky month when it comes to the weather. It can be warm and sunny one day and cold and rainy the next. Make sure to check the weather forecast before the wedding day and plan your outfit accordingly. If it's going to be cold, bring a coat or a shawl to keep warm. If it's going to be hot, choose lightweight fabrics that will keep you cool.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of What to Wear to an October Wedding 2021 UK</h2></p><p>When it comes to what to wear to an October wedding 2021 in the UK, the key is to dress appropriately for the dress code and the weather.
